                <h3>About Hilltop Country Estate</h3>
                <p>
                    Hilltop Country Estate, a memory care facility for seniors, was conceived out of a vision to create
                    a boutique-style community that evokes style and grace. Our goal is to provide our residents an
                    environment that stimulates the senses, where the beauty of nature abounds and residents have the
                    freedom to safely explore their surroundings in an environment that neither isolates nor limits
                    their movement behind locked doors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hilltop Country Estate offers a unique and distinctive landscape and Italian inspired architecture.
                    It sits nestled between gently rolling hills in the center of North Escondido and is bordered by
                    major streets on each side of the property for visibility and accessibility. The decorative wrought
                    iron gate opens up to welcome our guests to approximately 10 acres of property surrounded by
                    matured tress, rock formations, a growing vineyard, multiple oak trees, and a winding driveway
                    lined with a white picket fence leading up to 4 separate villas spread out and built on expansive
                    areas of land.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hilltop Country Estate is an exclusive 29-bed licensed facility serving seniors with mild to
                    moderate dementia. It consists of four individual villas with a small capacity of 4 to 11 residents
                    per villa giving it a warm, personal
                    experience reminiscent of one's own home. Each villa has its own features and personality suited to
                    the individual needs of our residents.
